# NUS3BANK Editor
_by jam1garner (1.0-1.7 then support) and BlueDan aka BDS aka DanSyor (1.7-now)_

This is a GUI for Windows users to convert and import audio tracks into nus3bank files. Nus3bank files are basically a set of idsp audio tracks (for bgm, they most likely have only one track) that can feature a loop or not.

You need Python 2.7 installed to run it. Or since 2.20, Python 3.5!

Run `NUS3BANK Editor.pyw` either on your file explorer or on console.
Or since 2.10 you can use `NUS3BANK_Editor.bat`, that you can bind to be the default program to open files with nus3bank extension.


### Credits:
- Soneek who made tools essential for this
- everyone involved with vgmstream
- everyone involved with ffmpeg
- everyone who tested this tool and gave feedback

### Known issues:
* Crack noise at the end of loops
* You might have encoding problems (some error window popping up yelling at you something about UnicodeEncodeError) related to characters within the paths of files you're using. I try my best for you to avoid those but unfortunately the behaviour doesn't seem consistent from one computer to another. If you're using Python 2.7 and encounter these issues, either be careful about any potentially exotic character in the paths of your files, or consider switching to Python 3.5.
    
### Troubleshooting
Be sure to grab the latest version, for now download links are posted on the [GBATemp Thread](http://gbatemp.net/threads/easy-nus3bank-editor-with-gui.426370/) by BlueDan as BDS.

You may want to check the latest pages in case any specific hotfix was posted.

If you encounter any error, please provide (on the above thread or PM BlueDan on Discord) a clear and detailed explanation of what you're attempting to achive and how you do so. A screenshot of the error is highly appreciated.

You may want to use NUS3BANK_Editor_troubleshooting.bat to have a better chance to screenshot any error.
 * "When trying to use NUS3BANK_Editor.bat, an error pops up: ``Windows cannot find 'pythonw'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.``
  * Looks like Python is not in your environment variable PATH. Follow the following instructions (these are for Python 2.7):
        - Right click on the windows logo (or hit windows + pause and go to step 3)
        - Select system
        - Select advanced settings
        - Environment variables
        - Find path, click edit
        - Select new and enter C:\Python27\
        - Select new (again) and enter C:\Python27\Scripts
        - If you have any cmd opened, you should close them before checking your %path% again
        - Try first with system variables then user variables

### Changelog:

_2.20_ - 2016/06/?
 * Fixed other encoding problems for input file
 * Fixed encoding problems regarding nus3bank extraction
 * Fully ported to Python 3.5: if you still have encoding problems, consider switching
 * Disabled log file creation and re-enable DOS output when it exists (= launched from python.exe, no pythonw.exe)
 * Doesn't ask anymore for a confirmation to close the file when no change has been done since last save
 * workspace/tmpspace folder now gets deleted when empty

_2.13b_ - 2016/06/04
 * Updated NUS3BANK_Editor.bat so no DOS console pops up
 * Fixed IOError 9 when trying to print to a non-existent DOS console
    
_2.13a_ - 2016/06/04
 * Fixed other encoding issues (paths related)
 * Made traceback visible for errors happening with nus3bank extraction

_2.13_ - 2016/06/03
 * Fixed playlist creation (on previous versions, an m3u could be left opened after nus3bank extraction failed, eventually causing an error when clearing workspace)
 * Changed colors for the path of the file (gray = no changes, no need to save; blue = changes (probably), should save)
 * Better algorithm for partial display of path
 * Alternates background color for tracks for better visibility
 * Various changes in how the app closes files/itself
 * Fixed encoding for errors (â€¦)

_2.12_ - 2016/06/03
 * Hotfix so that it works either like in 2.10 or in 2.11 when deleting these temporary files (previous hotfix broke it for others)

_2.11_ - 2016/06/03
 * Hotfix for an issue when deleting temporary files without being in the main folder

_2.10_ - 2016/06/03
 * Fixed some menu entries with wrong action
 * Fixed default name when exporting
 * Opening a NUS3BANK now sets focus inside the list, so you can scroll directly
 * You can now preview a selection of tracks: either click the button, use the File menu, double click or hit enter/return
 * Right-clicking now allows you to select one track or can be used on a set of tracks already selected and grants the user with a context menu with replace/revert/preview/export options
 * Fixed something I forgot to edit within nus3bank.py and nus3inject.py
 * Better error handling (yes, again!)
 * Added a batch file that can be used to open and edit nus3bank files anywhere you can go with your file explorer (code edited so that everything works fine)
 * Window is now truly resizable
 * Added on-screen indicator of whether or not changes have apparently be applied or not (so that you save) (green = no changes since last save; red = maybe changes from last save)
 * It also gives you the path to the file you're currently editing (the .nus3bank extension is hidden)
 * A major design flow that could prevent two instances to work correctly simultaneously has been fixed
 * Fixed some encoding problems (no more UnicodeEncodingError?)

_2.02_ - 2016/06/01
 * Now supports directly DSP and HSP files (audio replacement)
 * Added the option to consider "unknown" extensions as VGM files (audio replacement)

_2.01_ - 2016/05/31
 * Fixed "Saving as..."
 * Opening nus3bank files and saving should now work for people who had an error trying to

_2.00_ - 2016/05/31
 * Now uses ffmpeg to support a LOT more file types (literally anything ffmpeg can convert to wav, from MP3 to video files)
 * Added an x-axis scrollbar
 * Entries go blue when replaced
 * Error handling enhanced (yes, again!)
 * Grouped some extensions together (like .wav with .ogg and .mp3; .bXstm together) + added wildcard extension for any extra extension that works (video files...) for easier use
 * Added the ability to revert replacements
 * Now uses a set workspace folder instead of a file-dependant folder
 * Saving when the user wants (injections into nus3bank are done only when actually saving instead of whenever replacing an idsp; replacing an idsp only converts the file to idsp and puts it in the preview playlist)
 * Ability to save as another nus3bank file added
 * Fixing playlist path, take 2
 * Reworked conversion to idsp for replacement sounds. Can loop audio on demand.
 * Menu entries with keyboard shortcuts have been added
 * The "Export to WAV" button has been removed and replaced with a menu entry that can also export an idsp with no conversion

_1.96_ - 2016/05/27
 * Now copies replacement audio files to tmp files to ensure filename to be supported

_1.95_ - 2016/05/27
 * Fixed a bug where replacement idsp was not properly located and probably no change happened
 * Added better error handling for the conversion of replacement audio files to IDSP
 * Now makes a backup of the nus3bank file when replacing its idsp's
 * Replacing idsp's in the file also replaces them within the playlist, backups are made for replaced idsp's
 * Fixing playlist path, take 1
 * Fixed a bug that could happen and prevent from opening idsp's or replacing them

_1.9_ - 2016/05/26

_1.5_ - 2016/05/18
 * Added the ability to open idsps from within the tool through the default IDSP opener. To set this up install a something that can listen to idsps (example: foobar2000+vgmstream) and open an idsp in any way, when prompted select open with foobar (or whatever program you want)
